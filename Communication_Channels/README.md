## What has been done

Wrote implem in the file [Specification.md](./src/Specification.md)
Have a picture of the design in the file [Design.md](./src/Design.md)

The implementation is tested in the file [example.java](./src/tests/example.java)

The implementation tried to cover all the requirements in the specification (with a few mistakes obviously), the tests
are as follows:
- One tests 2 tasks and one broker
- One tests 2 tasks and 2 brokers
- One tests n tasks and n brokers
- One tests 2 tasks with one of them disconnecting mid-way

All the tests are successful.

## What is left to do

- The implementation is not perfect, there are some mistakes in the code need to be fixed thanks to the explanation of this course.
